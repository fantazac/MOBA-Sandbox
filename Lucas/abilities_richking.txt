Activate: Summon 1/2/3 knights (undead?) that move 
with the king (or like tibbers?). Abilities work 
with the knights.

----------

Passive: Each basic attack steals energy and stores 
it in the orb. Once it reaches 100% energy, the next 
basic attack has increased range and will shoot the 
orb at the selected target. It deals damage to all 
units it passes through.

----------

Activate: Orb becomes a perfect shield for a maximum 
of 3 seconds. It stores 40% of the damage the first 
blocked attack/ability was supposed to do + 10% of 
each subsequent ones, up to 80%. 

For 3 seconds after the shield wears off/is 
deactivated, he gets his passive. The damage is 
increased by the stored energy from the shield 
and will use this energy to deal extra damage. Each 
subsequent target takes 10% damage less from the 
bonus until it reaches its normal value (cannot go 
under the base passive damage).

He cannot use any other ability while the shield 
is active.
